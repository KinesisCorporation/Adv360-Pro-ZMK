## Building the Firmware in a local container

### Setup

#### Software

* Either Podman or Docker is required, Podman is preferred if both are present.
* Make is also required

#### Windows specific

* If compiling on Windows use WSL2 and Docker [Docker Setup Guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/).
* Install make using `sudo apt-get install make`.
* The repository can be cloned directly into the WSL2 instance or accessed through the C: mount point WSL provides by default (`/mnt/c/path-to-repo`).

### Build firmware

1. Execute `make`.
2. Check the `firmware` directory for the latest firmware build.

### Cleanup

The built docker container and compiled firmware files can be deleted with `make clean`.

## Flashing firmware

Follow the programming instruction on page 8 of the [Quick Start Guide](https://kinesis-ergo.com/wp-content/uploads/Advantage360-Professional-QSG-v8-25-22.pdf) to flash the firmware.
